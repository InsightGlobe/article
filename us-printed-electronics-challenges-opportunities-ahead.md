<p>Printed electronics involves utilizing various printing techniques to create electronic devices on a variety of materials like paper, plastic, and fabric. It includes applying conductive, semiconductive, or insulating inks onto these surfaces to create electronic components like transistors, capacitors, and sensors. This technology allows for the creation of bendable, light, and potentially inexpensive electronic devices used for RFID tags, flexible displays, sensors, and smart packaging. It is widely used in a variety of industries, such as electronics, Semiconductors &amp; Electronics, media, and healthcare, among others, due to its diverse range of applications. The industries mentioned above have a high adoption rate of this modern technology because of its various advantages, which include thickness, flexibility, and cost. Intelligent packaging is gaining importance in the US. It is expected to rapidly supplant traditional packaging by enabling quality control and tracking shipments of the products being packaged. Intelligent packaging typically employs Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) technologies and Near-Field Communication (NFC) to connect producers with their customers and verify the authenticity of various items, such as fragrances and wines. Rewritable chips may serve as tags for intelligent packaging and are expected to substitute the standard bar code labeling technology.</p>
