<p>Biosimilars are biological medical products that are similar to other biological medicines that are already approved. In terms of potency, safety, and purity, biosimilars are quite comparable to the reference product; nevertheless, there may be slight variations in the therapeutically inert ingredients. The FDA may demand that manufacturers carry out a clinical trial (or studies) sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, or potency in one or more uses for which the reference product is licensed and for which the biosimilar applies for licensure before approving biosimilars. The increasing awareness among patients and healthcare professionals about therapeutic agents leads to accelerating the adoption and usage of biosimilars by biosimilar manufacturers and regulators. The primary trend in the market is the growing amount of funds that pharmaceutical companies are spending on research and development (R&amp;D) to improve biosimilar pipelines. Strategic alliances and collaborations to quicken market entry are notably on the rise.</p>
