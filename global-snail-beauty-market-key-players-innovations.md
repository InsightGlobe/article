<p>Snail cosmetics are made from snail slime. This is secreted by a snail as external mucus through its body. The antioxidants found in snail mucus, such as hyaluronic acid, glycolic acid, and elastin, reduce the visibility of wrinkles, acne, dark spots, rosacea, and other skin disorders. Snail beauty essences, masks, moisturizers, creams, serums, and cleansers are among the many snail beauty products that are readily accessible on the market. The medicinal chemicals found in snail slime are highly concentrated and help in cell turnover and skin regeneration. Anti-aging conditioners made from snail secretion products are also used to treat hair issues related to discoloration of the hair that comes with aging. Middle-aged consumers' inclination for grooming products is another factor driving up the market value of snail beauty products.
